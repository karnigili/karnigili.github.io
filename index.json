Such behavior may, in turn, reflect rational information gathering and thereby connect to theoretical accounts of exploration in other settings. For instance, a preference for novel stimuli that habituates with exposure might reflect the diminishing value of information over repeated samples. From this perspective, though, it is surprising that novelty preferences are not universal, and that instead the opposite preference – favoring more familiar stimuli – is also observed. In a classic phenomenological model, Hunter and Ames (1988) suggest that a progression from familiarity to novelty preference arises due to an inverted U-shaped preference for a stimulus with exposure. This poses a puzzle for connecting infant exploration to rational information gathering- Why should the value of information not decline monotonically as a stimulus is sampled? We propose a computational theory for the Hunter and Ames (1988) phenomena by connecting them to a line of work in which we have analyzed value of information in sequential decision tasks, in terms of the expected improvement in future returns. The insight of this work is that this value can be decomposed into the product of two terms, Gain and Need. Gain reflects the additional rewards due to exploration producing better decisions at the explored state- this reflects the information received and is monotonically decreasing over exposures. But in a sequential task, these rewards are only realized when that state is revisited- thus value of exploration depends on Need, i.e. expected future occupancy of the explored state. We propose that infant exploration can be explained in the same terms, with familiarity preference arising due to Need. This perspective offers a new connection between infant and computational exploration, and new interpretations and predictions about the factors that impact infants' exploratory attention.","tags":null,"title":"A Rational Information Gathering Account of Infant Exploratory Behavior","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Metzner C.","Mäki-Marttunen T.","Karni G.","McMahon-Cole H.","Steuber V."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1599696000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599696000,"objectID":"457d28c1ad402cac3ffa6b0a65765ad5","permalink":"https://karnigili.github.io/publication/gamma/","publishdate":"2020-09-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gamma/","section":"publication","summary":"Abnormalities in the synchronized oscillatory activity of neurons in general and, specifically in the gamma band, might play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. While these changes in oscillatory activity have traditionally been linked to alterations at the synaptic level, we demonstrate here, using computational modeling, that common genetic variants of ion channels can contribute strongly to this effect. Our model of primary auditory cortex highlights multiple schizophrenia-associated genetic variants that reduce gamma power in an auditory steady-state response task. Furthermore, we show that combinations of several of these schizophrenia-associated variants can produce similar effects as the more traditionally considered synaptic changes. Overall, our study provides a mechanistic link between schizophrenia-associated common genetic variants, as identified by genome-wide association studies, and one of the most robust neurophysiological endophenotypes of schizophrenia.","tags":null,"title":"The Effect of Alterations of Schizophrenia-Associated Genes on Gamma Band Oscillations.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karni G.","Metzner C."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1594080000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594080000,"objectID":"dbeda853677b969fd21e180872c5939d","permalink":"https://karnigili.github.io/publication/szc_model/","publishdate":"2020-07-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/szc_model/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent advances in computational modeling, genome-wide association studies, neuroimaging, and theoretical neuroscience pose better opportunities to study neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia (SZC)[4]. However, despite a repeated examination of its well-characterized phenotypes, our understanding of SZC's neurophysiological biomarkers or cortical dynamics remain elusive. This study presents a biophysical spiking neuron model of perceptual inference, based on the predictive coding framework [1]. The model, implemented in NetPyNE [6], incorporates various single-cell models of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons [2,8,5], mimicking the circuits of the primary auditory cortex. This model allows for the exploration of the effects bio-genetic variants (expressed via ion-channels or synaptic mechanisms alternation) have on auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) deficits, a common biomarker for SZC [3]. More particularly, the model distinguishes between repetition suppression and prediction error and examines their respective contribution to the MMN. The first part of this report establishes the model's explanatory power using two well-known paradigms- the oddball paradigm and the cascade paradigm. Both can reproduce the electrophysiological measures of the MMN among healthy subjects. Later, via tuning the parameters of single-neuron equations or the network's synaptic weights, the model exhibits the expected LFP changes associated with SZC [7]. Therefore, this model enables exploring how biogenetic alterations affect the underlying components of the observed MMN deficits. Novel, yet preliminary, predictions are presented and suggested future steps for validations are listed. This model could support studies exploring genetic effects on the MMN (or other aspects of predictive coding) in the auditory cortex.","tags":null,"title":"A Cortical Model Examining Mismatch Negativity Deficits Under Schizophrenia-Linked Variants","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8a82d354ea27d191a96f5f88ebb1bffd","permalink":"https://karnigili.github.io/project/adhd/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/adhd/","section":"project","summary":"From extracting resting-state networks to calculating the classification significance","tags":null,"title":"Classifying ADHD from Healthy Controls using LSTMs with rs-fMRI Data","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"a2197aa3de38f6fe7b73bdcabee0d1c3","permalink":"https://karnigili.github.io/project/curiosity-driven-rl/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/curiosity-driven-rl/","section":"project","summary":"A guide for building an ICM agent using Keras and OpenAI Gym.","tags":null,"title":"Curiosity-Driven Learning with OpenAI and Keras","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"aeab7027345f2c152b8f2974b6d58e17","permalink":"https://karnigili.github.io/project/deeprl/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/deeprl/","section":"project","summary":"Taking a stab at the fine art of parameter tuning","tags":null,"title":"Deep RL Debugging and Diagnostics","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"a4a6209c9cdbfed0f0115c76027e3a23","permalink":"https://karnigili.github.io/project/fmri-ica/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fmri-ica/","section":"project","summary":"From data collection to feature extraction","tags":null,"title":"Identifying Resting-State Networks from fMRI Data Using ICAs","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"9d0c2c43e233d05c8b59dc7c3652c8db","permalink":"https://karnigili.github.io/project/nivlab/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/nivlab/","section":"project","summary":"Niv lab's hub that links together all of the technical resources developed for and by members of the lab.","tags":null,"title":"nivlab.github.io","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"5ed703872216104640fc95c3866d79db","permalink":"https://karnigili.github.io/project/policy-gradient/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/policy-gradient/","section":"project","summary":"A step by step approach to understanding REINFORCE","tags":null,"title":"Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning with Keras","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"24d046cbc6d2b10e6228e611d3324e71","permalink":"https://karnigili.github.io/project/netpyne/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/netpyne/","section":"project","summary":"Exploring the effect of neuromodulation on oscillatory patterns","tags":null,"title":"Simulating Biological Neural Networks with NetPyNE","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"05f5f2e362b0cea9cda5393087b1af04","permalink":"https://karnigili.github.io/project/capstone/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/capstone/","section":"project","summary":"Modeling Complex Systems — The Case of Abnormal Predictive Coding","tags":null,"title":"What Can Schizophrenia Tell Us About How the Brain Predicts the Future?","type":"project"}]
